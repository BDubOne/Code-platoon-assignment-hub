pip install Django

pip install --upgrade pip

we will only use settings.py and urls.py directly.  We will access manage.py. There is no need to mess with any of the other premade py files in Django

on settings.py,

Installed Apps may be added. Pretty much all of the original files will not need to be touched.


the Databases {} dictionary will be modified


you can adjust default language and timezone


you can direct your program to specific files (js, css, images)

python manage.py startapp_<app_name>

In settings.py, if you add an app, place the app in Installed_APPS in the settings.py

in models.py is where sql tabls are generated using python.


add a python class

class <classname>(models.Model):
'''model template '''
<varchar attribute>= models.charField(max_length=255),
<integer attribute with default> = models.IntegerField(default=1)
<boolean attribute with default> = models.BooleanField(default=False)

python manage.py makemigrations is the command for making a new migration if needed.

You can run this any time you modify the models or apps in the django project

python manage.py migrate is the command for executing migrations. //

python manage.py shell enters the command line interface for dealing with the django program

>>> from pokemon_app.models import Pokemon
>>> pikachu = Pokemon(name = 'Pikachu', level = 12)
>>> pikachu.save()

>>> charmander = Pokemon(name = 'Charmander', level=12)
>>> charmander.save()
>>> Pokemon.objects.all()

>>> all_poke =Pokemon. objects.all()
