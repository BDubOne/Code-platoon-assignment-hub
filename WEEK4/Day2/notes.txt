#RDBMS
Relational Database Management system

Postgres is a popular RDBM. It uses sql and is able to return data to individual developers.

We can hook it to back-end servers and run python programs that run it


No capital leters when making databases.

CREATE DATABASE students;

\c connnect

CREATE TABLE student (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR (20), --VARCHAR saves the amount of space in parentheses and allows an input of up to that amount.
    last_name VARCHAR (20),
    age INT,

    COPY
