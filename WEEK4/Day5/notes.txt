HTTP protocol was originlly designed for transmitting hypertext.

Modern equivalent of hypertext is html

HTTP transmits html, css, api responces, javascript and quite a few other things.

PUT, POST, DELETE, GET

Get request recieves a response:

ie: 200 OK HTTP/1.1

Content-length: 424

GET -Retrieve a resource
Post: send a resource
Put: update resource
Delete: delete a resource

GET / <uri name>  HTTP/ 1.1

URN has a Host + uri
URL has a Protocol + Host + uri

Request format:

Request line (get-request)

Header:
Host:
User0Agent:

query=new+jordans&color=red

Request Headers provide additional contetxt about the request.

Host tells the web server which domain the client is requesting content from. Often one web server will serve content for multiple domains, sometimes called virtual hosts. The server uses this header to determine which content to serve.

Accept-language: en::::The client lets the server know which languages it prefers the response be sent back in.

User-Agent:  which type of client sent this request. Sometimes the server will respond differently based on the UA field.

Accept: text/html, text/plain:  Is this client recieving html or json?


Responses also have headers:  Length, date, content-type

Status codes:

200: OK
302: See other --endpoint doesn't exist. Go here instead <!>
400: bad request  --client problem
401: unauthorized
404: not found
500: internal server error --server problem
