types of test:

unit test:  (functional or component isolated) -- super fast, cheap, not effective for fullstack applications

integration test (API Call [back-end server]) --takes more time (asynchronous functions), not cheap, effective

e2e test: behavior from when a browser is open to the visit to the interaction to the engagement with any back-end servers - to what the user sees on the page
very expensive. very effective

What to write tests for:
    ...important to functionality
    ...important to business

cons:
takes time to write the test
takes time to understand errors
more code involved: pretty much double
test could have an error

pros:
saves time debugging


What is TDD?
Writing the tests first

For REACT, we use Cypress and puppeteer

for Django, we use native tests for both REST frameworks and for the actual tests

cypress:

 npm install cypress --save-dev

 npx cypress open
