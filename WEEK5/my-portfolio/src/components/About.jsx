            <p>
            In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, I am committed to harnessing the power of technology to enhance human well-being and promote lifelong learning. Drawing from diverse experiences in theology, arts, and holistic healing, I aim to create innovative software solutions that celebrate the intersection of language, mathematics, and art. By leveraging coding as a universal language, I aspire to build bridges among diverse communities, ensuring that technology enriches the human experience, rather than compromising it.
