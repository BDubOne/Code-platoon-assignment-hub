Npm: Node Package Manager

Node--framework through which we run js

We can alter npm based on which project we are doing and what behavior we want it to follow.

--Commands---

npm -v  (shows latest version)

npm init (initializes npm and makes a package.json file)

npm init -y (say yes to all)

licenses: ISC, MID, Apache2.0

Dependencies:

axios, for instance, and jest

If you want to use an import instead of require, you need to set a "type": "module"

REACT!

What is react??
It is a magical library:

A front-end framework developed by Facebook and made open-source
By getting a bunch of developers to interact with it, it has had a history of lots of refactoring and debugging from many sources (like linux)

React: html/css
React Native: tags belonging to phone development.


Vite?
Vite takes react application and compiles it, also rendering it into a development server

create a utilities.jsx file and make hooks
