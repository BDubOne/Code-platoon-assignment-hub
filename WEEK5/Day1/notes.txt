Npm: Node Package Manager

Node--framework through which we run js

We can alter npm based on which project we are doing and what behavior we want it to follow.

--Commands---

npm -v  (shows latest version)

npm init (initializes npm and makes a package.json file)

npm init -y (say yes to all)

licenses: ISC, MID, Apache2.0

Dependencies:

axios, for instance, and jest

If you want to use an import instead of require, you need to set a "type": "module"
